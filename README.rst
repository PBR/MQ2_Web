A web application for MQ2 to quickly visualize output from MapQTL analysis

Assuming one QTL per linkage group and using the LOD threshold set by the user.
This application extracts all the QTLs detected by MapQTL, using the JoinMap
map file, it finds the closest marker and finally put the number of QTLs found
for each marker on the map.

This approach quickly allows you to find and visualize potential QTL hotspot
in your dataset. This is particularly usefull for large QTL analysis on a
large number of traits.


Get this project:
-----------------
Source:  https://github.com/PBR/MQ2_Web


Dependencies:
-------------
.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/

This project is a `Flask`_ application, as such it depends on:
- python-flask
- python-flask-wtf
- python-wtforms

.. _MQ2: https://github.com/PBR/MQ2

Since this project is a web-interface to MQ2, it requires `MQ2`_ installed.


Deploying this project:
-----------------------

.. _Flask deployment documentation: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/

Instruction to deploy this application is available on the
`Flask deployment documentation`_ page.

My approach.

Retrieve the sources:
 cd /srv/
 git clone <repo>
 cd MQ2_Web

Copy the configuration file
 cp mq2.cfg.sample mq2.cfg

Adjust the configuration file (upload folder, secret key...)

Don't forget to create the folder and set its right it you use a specific one,
for example if you use ``/var/www/uploads`` as upload folder:
 sudo mkdir /var/www/uploads
 sudo chown apache:apache /var/www/uploads

Then configure apache:
 sudo vim /etc/httd/conf.d/wsgi.conf
and put in this file:
 WSGIScriptAlias /mq2 /var/www/wsgi/mq2.wsgi
 <Directory /var/www/wsgi/>
     Order deny,allow
     Allow from all
 </Directory>
Then create the file /var/www/wsgi/mq2.wsgi with:
 import sys
 sys.path.insert(0, '/srv/MQ2_Web')
 
 import mq2_web
 application = mq2_web.APP
Then restart apache and you should be able to access the website on
http://localhost/mq2
